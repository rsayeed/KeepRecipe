# Keep Recipe
Android media application that keeps track of your favorite recipes. This was a suggested project on the Udacity Android Fast Track program. I have decided to implement the core functionality of the application as well as add some extra features to provide users with a complete Recipe management application.

## The app
<ul>
<li>The app allows users to keep track of their favorite recipes </li>
<li>Gives users the ability to create and view recipes, ingredients, and instructional videos</li>
<li>Makes use of ExoPlayer API to load and display videos from a given URL</li>
<li>Use of fragments to present dynamic content in single pane/multi-pane layouts along with the proper handling of configuration changes</li>
<li>Use of various Android components such as Recycler views and Content Providers for dynamic loading of data</li>
<li>Comes with a widget that allows user's to quickly browse thru all the Recipe's in their collection along with the assoicated ingredients<li>
<li>Use of Material Design guidelines for color schemes and layouts</li>
<li>Optimized for both Mobile/Tablet use</li>
